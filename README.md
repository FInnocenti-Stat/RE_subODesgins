This repository contains a R/Shiny app to compute the relative efficiency and the required sample size increase for a sub-optimal design versus the optimal design given a model for test norming

To run the code you would need:

An installation of R (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
With a shiny library (install.packages("shiny")).
then run this code:
